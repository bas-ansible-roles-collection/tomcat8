# Flush handlers

# This ensures any pending handlers are executed before any tests are performed. This is particularly important where
# a service needs to be restarted before new configuration options are used for example.

# Reload local facts

# Atomic tests
#
# These tests mirror individual tasks to ensure they execute correctly
# E.g. creating a user, installing the right package or generating a valid configuration file

- include: atomic/register-role.yml

# Functionality tests
#
# These tests ensure overall processes can be completed to give a valid result
# E.g. checking a web-server serves a web-page ensures the relevant packages and configuration files work together
